### Solar Flare Impact on the Ionosphere-Thermosphere System:

- How does solar flare create the impulse in the ionospheric electrodynamics (Sq, Equatorial, and Auroral Electrojets)?
  >
  > Ground-based HF radar observations have revealed the abrupt emergence of ionospheric backscatters, indicative of decameter-scale field-aligned irregularities, in close temporal proximity to the dawn terminator and after a substantial X9.3 solar flare. These irregularities, exhibiting radar line-of-sight Doppler velocities nearing 300 m/s, were aligned with equatorward reverse convection flow. To further investigate this phenomenon, I have been honored with the esteemed 'Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship (Short-term)' and the 'ISEE International Joint Research Fellowship from Nagoya University.' These prestigious fellowships support my engagement in international collaborative research in Japan, where I will delve into the intricate dynamics and implications of these ionospheric irregularities, contributing to the global understanding of space weather phenomena.

### Geomagnetic Disturbance (GMD) Impact on the Submarine Cables:
This research is focused on the characterization of induced underwater geoelectric fields (GEFs) and potential along submarine cables during various geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs). Geomagnetic disturbances, originating from diverse space weather phenomena, induce GEFs at different spatiotemporal scales within the Earth and water bodies. These GEFs, in turn, generate geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that flow through electrical infrastructure, posing a significant risk to critical systems like submarine cables during intense space weather events. To achieve this, we utilize [SCUBAS](https://scubas.readthedocs.io/), an open-source computational model developed in Python, specifically designed to estimate induced underwater GEFs and voltage in the presence of geomagnetic perturbations recorded by ground-based magnetometers. SCUBAS leverages advancements in magnetotelluric (MT) studies and GIC understanding, marking a substantial advancement in analyzing and predicting the impact of space weather on submarine cable systems. This research addresses critical concerns in safeguarding submarine cable infrastructure against space weather-induced disruptions. 

SCUBAS employs a generalized thin sheet analysis specifically designed for frequencies that penetrate through both the conductive and resistive layers. This analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of the electromagnetic behavior of this layered structure (Ranganayaki and Madden, 1980).

More recently, Wang et al. (2023) demonstrated that the generalized thin sheet analysis can be effectively implemented by representing the double layer as a transmission line. This transmission line model incorporates the concept of series impedance, denoted as  \(Z\), which takes into account the resistivity and thickness of the conductive layers. Additionally, it considers a parallel impedance, denoted as  \(Y\), which accounts for the resistance through the resistive layers. The figure illustrates the schematic representation of the double-layer structure and its equivalent transmission line model incorporating \(Z\) and \(Y\) impedances.
 
### Characterization of Terrestrial Source Triggered Gravity Waves (GWs):
This research focuses on investigating the influence of ionospheric disturbances generated by thunderstorms and snowstorms on High-Frequency (HF) communication systems utilizing SuperDARN radars. Employing the Provision of High-Frequency Raytracing Laboratory for Propagation Studies (PHaRLAP), a 3D raytracing tool, I aim to quantify alterations in the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF). This assessment is crucial for understanding the impact of transient ionospheric irregularities induced by severe weather phenomena on HF radio wave propagation. The methodology involves utilizing observational data from SuperDARN radars, which are adept at capturing the dynamic behavior of the ionosphere during such meteorological events. The quantitative analysis of changes in MUF serves as a robust metric to assess the resilience and reliability of HF communication systems under the influence of natural atmospheric disturbances. This work contributes to the broader understanding of ionospheric effects on radio wave propagation, providing valuable insights for optimizing communication systems in adverse weather conditions[^1].
