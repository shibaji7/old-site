## Appointments & Work Experience
**Postdoctoral Associate | [Virginia Tech](http://vt.superdarn.org/) (_May 2021-present_)**
  >
  > A 3 years' work experience at [SuperDARN Group](http://vt.superdarn.org/), Virginia Tech working under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Baker and Dr. J. Michael Ruohoniemi. Reserach is related to effects and impacts of Space Weather on HF propagation using SuperDARN. The study is mainly focused on effects and impacts of solar flare driven Shortwave-Faceout and aims to provide a probabilistic now-cast of ionospheric HF propagation conditions using numerical, semi-empirical and data-based models during during solar flares. Tools and Software used for research: Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, Word, Latex, Overleaf, DavitPy (Specific to SuperDARN), and SQLite.
